# Numbers

This repository tries to create a repository of handwritten digits,
much like
the
[MNIST database of handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
In Switzerland, the handwritten digites sometimes look a bit
different, which is why we undertake this effort.

Our goal was 10,000 handwritten digits and we have met that goal! If
you want to help us reach 20,000 handwritten digits, check out
the [tools](tools/) directory.

# Meta Data

The directory name of every contribution adheres to the following
naming scheme:

1. four digits to identify the person
2. an underscore character
3. two letter country code ([ISO 3166 Alpha-2 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes)) or `XX` if unknown (e.g. Switzerland is `CH`)
4. age, rounded to the nearest decade (e.g. 35 to 44 years is `4`) or `XX` if unknown
5. sex (`M` for man, `F` for woman, `X` for unknown, `O` for other)
